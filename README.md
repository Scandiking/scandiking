# Hello, World! üåê

I am a 31 year old student doing a B.Sc. in [Information Systems and Information Technology](https://www.usn.no/studier/bachelor-i-it-og-informasjonssystemer/) at University of South-Eastern Norway! I've been using computers since 1998 at 4 years old when my dad showed me Moto Racer (1997) on our Compaq Presario 5600 hidden under the desktop board because you used to hide your computers back then

The [soundtrack of Moto Racer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXvS28XM8NI&list=PL_BhbJAAueZRAXlV7sdOm2oOH1XHjNRvE) (1997) is still üî•

While I might have been introduced to computers as and for fun, I've grown to see the potential as well as the ever growing utility and use among the general population. I've seen fright for tech turn around into seeing tech as a helpful tool in assisting staff with their duties, whether that be point-of-sale systems, stock management systems or private security missions.
