# Hello, World! üåê

I am a 31 year old student doing a B.Sc. in [Information Systems and Information Technology](https://www.usn.no/studier/bachelor-i-it-og-informasjonssystemer/) at University of South-Eastern Norway! I've been using computers since 1998 at 4 years old when my dad showed me Moto Racer (1997) on our Compaq Presario 5600.

While I might've been introduced to computers as fun, over time it has shown its potential and evergrowing utility and use among the general population, the more refined the tools have become, and I would love to partake in that journey and make IT projects that can aid workers and ease and effectivize their work. 


### üóÇÔ∏è Ongoing projects
- [Tvennings portfolio](https://scandiking.github.io/TvenningsPortfolio), an online portfolio showcasing university work. The works are divided by courses such as basic programming and system development, and further into  fractional exam qualification tests.
- [Landlosen](https://github.com/Scandiking/Landlosen), a project as a basis for a technical interview for an internship at [SmartGIS](https://smartgis.no). It retrieves country information from [RestCountries](https://restcountries.com) API and serves it in a SvelteKit application.
- [DartBud](https://github.com/JonasELH/DartBud)
      Group course project. Planned to be `RC` with repo hosted on GitHub. Built with `Kotlin` in Android Studio. It is a calculator focused on doing the math while playing 501 darts with two players. The focus is first on developing the MVP, and then iterate it to support more functions, such as more players than the current two.
